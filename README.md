# Automatic_Tweet_Spam_Detection
 Machine Learning Project that filters out the spam tweets

Twitter spam is unwanted content manifesting in many ways! Including bulk messages, profanity, insults, hate speech, malicious links, and fraudulent reviews. Lets tackle this problem by building a classifier to detect when a tweet is "Quality" content or "Spam"! 

The goal is to develop an automated solution that filters out the spam tweets based on extracted features from the tweet content and other attributes.  

    The data set contains the following fields:
    •     Tweet
    This is the text that was tweeted
    •     following
    The number of people the account that tweeted is following
    •     followers
    The number of people following the account that tweeted
    •     actions
    The total number of favorites, replies, and retweets of said tweet
    •     is_retweet
    Binary [0,1] value: If 0 its not a retweet, if 1 it is a retweet
    •     location
    The self-written location provided by the user on their profile, May not exist, be "Unkown", and is 
    NOT standardized! ex. could be ("NY", "New York", "Upper East Side", Etc!)
    •     Type
    Either Quality or Spam
